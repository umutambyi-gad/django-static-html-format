# django static html format
When I'm on django project I spend much time formatting an html file after collecting static files
so in that case I created this script to automate it for me instead of going one on every static file's link in markup and add `{% static 'file' %}`

Just add all html files that you want to format on `fileToFormat.txt` text file like
```
C:/Users/username/index.html
C:/Users/username/path/home.html
```
after that run `format.py` script to format it.
